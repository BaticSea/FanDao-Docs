Introduction
===================================

What is FanDao?
--------

FanDao is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the FAN token. Each FAN token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FRAX) in the FanDao treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below.


What is the point of FanDao?
--------

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the FAN token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that FAN can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.


How do I participate in FanDao?
--------

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and bonding . Stakers stake their FAN tokens in return for more FAN tokens, while bonders provide LP or DAI tokens in exchange for discounted FAN tokens after a fixed vesting period. 


How can I benefit from FanDao?
--------

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new FAN tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.


Who created FanDao?
--------

FanDao is a fork of Olympus Dao, forked by Hank Zimmer.
